# lets say our main branch that we cloned had only REACT repository now we came out of REACT repo 
# and created a new directory/folder/repo on same level or higher level than 'REACT'

In this folder (here) to initialise git use : git init (this is now initialised repository).
if you do : ls -a   ; you will see .git means it is a git repo.

now it has become a git repo and other things after this are same
    - same steps that we followed in a cloned repository
