   # MERGE CONFLICTS. #

an event that takes place which git is unable to automatically resolve diffrences in codes between two commits
eg : branch1 : modified some lines in index.html
     branch2 : modified same lines in index.html i.e same files same lines
     now which code to consider is a conflict.

     git merge "branchName"
     conflict will be raised in common files : you will have to manualy select which Branch's changes you want to select.
        or do you want to do someother change in their place and any modification is allowed at that point.
    then again you will have to git add . and git commit ...
