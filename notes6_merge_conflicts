    MERGE CONFLICTS

an event that takes place which git is unable to automatically resolve diffrences in codes between two commits
eg : branch1 : modified some lines in index.html
     branch2: modified same lines in index.html i.e same files
     now which code to consider is a conflict.

     git merge "branchName"
     conflict will be raised in common files : you will have to manualy select which Branch's changes you want to select.
