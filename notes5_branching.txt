########## GIT BRANCHES ##########
    YOU might need to work in seprate branches
    create a copy of current branch into a new branch do changes
    meanwhile some changes were also done in main branch 
    later merge all branches into main branch. (HOW?)

# Branch Commands 

1. git branch   :-
    see all branches in current origin and current branch appears in green
2. git branch -M newName    :-  
    (new name works without quote also if there is no space.) (otherwise use quotes.)
    rename a branch
3. git checkout -b newBranchName    :-
    create a new Branch and checkout to that branch
4. git checkout anotherBranchName   :-
    switch to another branch
5. git branch -d branchName     :- 
    delete that branch you can not delete your current branch (selected one).


Note : 
- whenever you create a new branch then at that point a copy of all the content in your main 
    branch will be made in that new branch.
- now whatever change you do will only will reflect in newBranch and when you checkout from there 
    those will become invisible so never checkout without commit.

Note:-
use double quotes if there is a space in name else it is optional.

# MERGE CODE FROM VARIOUS BRANCHES.
# OPTION 1 : 2-2 karke merge karlo branches ko:
    1. git branch :  check branches status 
    2. git diff "anotheBranchName" : compare current branch status with anotherBranch status
    3. git merge "anotherBranchName" : merge current branch with another Branch.

#OPTION 2 : using github :
    -create a PR : Pull request 
    -it lets you tell others about changes you have pushed to a branch in repository on github.
    - after we have done some changes in our main branch we can send pull request to main branch using github
     there some senior developer working on main branch will review your code and accept/reject/give-review.

// DO THIS IF YOU RENAME ANY BRANCH IN GITHUB 

# The default branch has been renamed!
  newBranch is now named main

  If you have a local clone, you can update it by running the following commands.

    git branch -m newBranch main
    git fetch origin
    git branch -u origin/main main
    git remote set-head origin -a

# ALTERNATE BETTER OPTION : 
    git pull origin main    :  lets assume your final branch is main which is updated on github server after
     a merge; Now you want that changes to be reflected in your local device also. Just download changes from github using this.

# altername : 
    remove git clone from you local and again clone it.
