# you are working on some project in your editor and now to want to push that repo(folder) to github

1-> create a empty git repo without readme.md file.
follow these instructions.
    git init
    git remote add origin <-link of repo->      (origin ki jagh kuch aur naam bhi rakh sakte h origin ka)
    git remote -v           (to verify remote).
    git branch              (to check branch).
    git branch -M main      (to rename branch).
    git add . 
    git commit -m "msg"
    git push origin main
    or git push -u origin main  : now a shorthand is created from now-onwards "git push "hii kaafi rhega and always push to origin main

remote means on github server / website.

mostly this approach is not followed 
then what ? :-
    1.create your repo on github with readme file 
    2.clone that repo : git clone <-link->
    3.do changes.
    4. git add .
    5. git commit -m "msg1"
    6. git push -u origin <-branchName->
